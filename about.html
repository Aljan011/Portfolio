        <div class="sub-box-2"><p style="color:azure;" >Born and raised in Kathmandu City. SEE completed from Gyan Niketan Seconday School. +2 from Global College of Management. Currently IT student at Herald College Kathmandu. And now I'm 19 years old. It's been 12 weeks that I have joined Herald College and I have learned lots of different stuff. We got 4 modules for semester 1 here and my favourite module has to be Web-Technology probably because it is easy module than other beside Academic but I like Web Developing that might me the reason why I like this module better. I also tried html and css after my SEE during lockdown I used to study through w3schools which helped me alot and it also made this module a bit easier for me because I already had some idea what we will be doing here. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px; color: azure;" >Beside that I have a huge interest in listening music. My type of genre on music is classic rock music. I have few favourite bands that I often listen to which are: Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Mukti and Revival, RHCP, Albatross etc.</p>
